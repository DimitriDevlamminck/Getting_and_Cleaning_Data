You will find the code I have used + the explanation of each step in the file run_analysis.R

If you wish to use it, you will have to adjust the working directory top match the place t which you have downloaded the original files.

The script does;
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
